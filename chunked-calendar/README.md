## Calendar to make it easier to plan routines

https://tools.rknt.de/chunked-calendar

Weeks are great but too short for certain routines or goals. Years are too long. Quarters are great but being built from months they are rubbish. Months have different lengths and don't start on Mondays.

ISO Weeks to the rescue. We this calendar splits the year into:

- four quarters
- each quarter into three chunks of four weeks
- quarters end with a reset week

Every couple of years we get a year with 53 ISO weeks. The extra week becomes a second reset week in the fourth quarter.

The calender comes in two print friendly forms and should adapt to whatever papersize you select when printing.

Simply print this page. All controls will be hidden when printing.
